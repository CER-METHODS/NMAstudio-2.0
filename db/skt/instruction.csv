ADA,"ADA (Adalimumab) is a biologic used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It blocks tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a key inflammatory cytokine involved in psoriasis. By reducing TNF-α activity, it helps decrease skin inflammation, plaque formation, and related symptoms. Adalimumab is administered by subcutaneous injection on a scheduled dosing plan, often beginning with a loading dose. It is commonly used in long-term management and may be prescribed when other systemic treatments are not suitable. It is generally avoided in individuals with active infections or severe immune compromise."
APRE,"APRE (Apremilast) is an oral systemic treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It works through inhibition of phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), an enzyme involved in inflammatory signaling pathways. By regulating these pathways, Apremilast helps reduce cytokine activity linked to psoriasis. It is taken as a daily tablet, usually with an initial dose-titration schedule to minimize early gastrointestinal side effects. Apremilast is used in patients who prefer an oral option or who may not use biologic therapy. It is not recommended for individuals experiencing significant unintended weight loss or severe depression."
BIME,"BIME (Bimekizumab) is a biologic designed for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It selectively inhibits both IL-17A and IL-17F, two cytokines central to the psoriatic inflammatory cascade. Blocking both targets provides broad suppression of IL-17-driven inflammation. Bimekizumab is administered by subcutaneous injection following a structured dosing schedule, including a loading phase. It is often considered for individuals with extensive skin involvement or those who have not responded well to earlier biologic classes. It is generally avoided in people with active infections, as IL-17 inhibitors may reduce mucosal immune defenses."
BRODA,"BRODA (Brodalumab) is a biologic for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It blocks the IL-17 receptor A, preventing signaling from several IL-17 family cytokines involved in psoriasis. This broader receptor-level inhibition can produce rapid improvement in skin lesions. Brodalumab is given through subcutaneous injections at defined intervals. It is considered when other IL-17 or IL-23 pathway treatments have not been effective. Due to safety considerations, it is prescribed with attention to mental health history, and it is avoided in individuals with active serious infections."
CERTO,"CERTO (Certolizumab) is a TNF-α inhibitor used for managing moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Unlike some other TNF inhibitors, Certolizumab is pegylated and lacks an Fc region. It helps reduce inflammatory pathways that drive psoriatic lesions. It is administered by subcutaneous injection, typically beginning with loading doses followed by a maintenance schedule. Certolizumab may be considered in individuals who need systemic therapy and may prefer or require a TNF inhibitor. It is not used in people with active serious infections or untreated latent tuberculosis."
CICLO,"CICLO (Ciclosporin) is an oral immunosuppressant used for severe or rapidly worsening plaque psoriasis. It works by inhibiting calcineurin, reducing activation of T-cells that drive psoriatic inflammation. It is often used for short-term control, such as during severe flares, because long-term exposure can increase risks related to kidney function and blood pressure. Ciclosporin can be effective when fast symptom reduction is needed. It is not used in individuals with significant kidney disease, uncontrolled hypertension, or certain malignancy risks. Regular laboratory monitoring is required when it is prescribed."
DEUCRAVA,"DEUCRAVA (Deucravacitinib) is an oral treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It selectively inhibits TYK2, a signaling protein involved in cytokine pathways such as IL-23, IL-12, and type I interferons. By modulating these pathways, it helps reduce psoriatic inflammation. It is taken once daily without the need for dose titration. Deucravacitinib is considered for individuals seeking an oral alternative to injectable biologic therapies. It is avoided in people with active infections, and laboratory monitoring may be recommended depending on clinical context."
ETA,ETA (Etanercept) is a biologic used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It blocks TNF-α to reduce inflammatory processes associated with the disease. It is administered through subcutaneous injection on a scheduled regimen that may include a once- or twice-weekly dosing pattern. Etanercept may be used in long-term disease control or when other systemic treatments are not appropriate. It is avoided in individuals with untreated infections or certain immune-related conditions.
FUM,"FUM (Fumaric Acid) is an oral systemic therapy used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It modifies immune activity through effects on inflammatory signaling pathways, including activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Fumaric acid is typically introduced through a gradual dose-escalation regimen to improve tolerance. It is considered for individuals who prefer oral therapy or have contraindications to biologics. It may be avoided in people with significant gastrointestinal symptoms or certain blood count abnormalities, and periodic laboratory monitoring is usually recommended."
IFX,"IFX (Infliximab) is an intravenous biologic used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It is a monoclonal antibody targeting TNF-α, helping reduce inflammation and plaque activity. Treatment begins with induction infusions followed by scheduled maintenance infusions every several weeks. It may produce rapid improvements and is often used for severe or extensive disease. It is avoided in individuals with active infections, untreated latent tuberculosis, or certain heart-related conditions."
IXE,"IXE (Ixekizumab) is a biologic for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It targets IL-17A, a key cytokine involved in psoriatic inflammation. Treatment involves subcutaneous injections with a loading dose followed by maintenance dosing. Ixekizumab is considered for individuals who prefer IL-17 pathway therapies or when rapid improvement is desired. It is avoided in individuals with active infections, including uncontrolled fungal infections, due to IL-17’s role in mucosal immunity."
GUSEL,"GUSEL (Guselkumab) is a biologic used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It targets IL-23 by binding the p19 subunit, reducing activity in pathways that drive chronic inflammation and plaque formation. It is administered via subcutaneous injection with a loading dose, followed by dosing every eight weeks. Guselkumab is often chosen for its long dosing interval and sustained effectiveness. It is avoided in individuals with active infections."
MTX,"MTX (Methotrexate) is an oral or injectable systemic treatment for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It works by reducing immune-mediated inflammation through folate pathway modulation. It is taken weekly rather than daily and often combined with folic acid to support tolerance. MTX is widely used and may reduce both skin symptoms and joint involvement in psoriatic arthritis. It is not used during pregnancy or in individuals with liver disease, alcohol misuse, or bone-marrow suppression. Routine laboratory monitoring is required."
NETA,"NETA (Netakimab) is a biologic targeting IL-17A for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. By blocking IL-17A activity, it helps reduce inflammation and plaque development. It is administered through subcutaneous injections on an induction and maintenance schedule. Netakimab may be considered in individuals seeking an IL-17 inhibitor with less frequent dosing. It is avoided in people with active infections, given IL-17’s role in mucosal immune defense."
PBO,PBO (Placebo) refers to an inactive substance used in clinical trials to provide a comparison against active treatments.
RISAN,RISAN (Risankizumab) is a biologic targeting the IL-23 pathway through selective binding of the p19 subunit. It is used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and helps reduce inflammation and plaque severity. It is administered by subcutaneous injection with a loading schedule followed by dosing every twelve weeks. Its long interval between doses makes it appealing for long-term management. It is avoided in individuals with active infections.
SECU,"SECU (Secukinumab) is an IL-17A inhibitor used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. By blocking IL-17A, it reduces skin inflammation and plaque formation. It is administered by subcutaneous injection, starting with weekly loading doses and then switching to monthly dosing. Secukinumab is selected for individuals seeking IL-17-targeted therapy or who need rapid skin clearance. It is avoided in individuals with active infections or uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease."
SONELO,"SONELO (Sonelokimab) is an IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor used for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.
